LSN_exercises_delivery

For some exercises (especially for the ones that need to be run more than oncce) I created some shell script to run faster, and in the right way, the code. You can find the instructions at the start of the relative Jupyter Notebook, in *italic*.

Exercises 11 e 12 were ritten on Google Colab. I don't know if they completely work on Jupyter Notebooks as well (for example,  I remember that loading images was done in a different way).

Some exercise (like exercises 04 and 07) are quite slow to run: they have to process a lot of data. Please be patient!
